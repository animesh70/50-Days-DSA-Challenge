# ☕ 50-Day DSA Mastery Challenge (Java)

### A Structured Journey through Data Structures and Algorithms with Apna College

---

## 🪴 Welcome to the Challenge!

This repository documents my **50-day rigorous challenge** to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the **Java** programming language. The curriculum is primarily guided by the comprehensive material provided by **Apna College**.

The goal is simple: **50 days, 50 classes, 100% mastery.** Each day represents a new concept, a new challenge, and a step closer to becoming a proficient problem-solver.
